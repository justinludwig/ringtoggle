===========

Ring Toggle is a simple app which allows you to switch quickly among ring, vibrate, and silent modes, without fiddling around with any other android settings. Simply open the app and select a mode; the selected mode takes effect immediately.

You can install the latest version on your android phone by using the android Browser app to download it from the Downloads page (then select the downloaded .apk from the notifications bar to trigger the install prompt); alternatively, you can also install it from the Android Market.
